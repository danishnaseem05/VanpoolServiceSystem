# ABOUT

This is a web-based application (created using ruby on rails) that is used to serve as a vanpool service system for the users. Users can register for an account as either a rider or a driver. There is also an admin account that has additional functions, like approving drivers, creating vanpools for the users to ride or drive. The riders can join vanpools to ride; whereas the drivers have the option to do both ride and drive
