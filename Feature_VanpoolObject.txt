Depending on which organization is in charge of distributing the vehicles, the way vanpools work may differ. However, the following are typical for many vanpool programs in the United States:

You need to pay a set fee. Most programs have options starting at $50 per month, depending on how many riders you have.
This fare will include all costs regarding the vehicle. The vanpool coordinator is responsible for the group. Whoever
sets up their local vanpool usually becomes one of two primary drivers for the group. Though some programs allow you to
rotate drivers between all riders, usually only designated drivers drive and take home the vehicle due to the fact that
prior application or training is required. The coordinator usually becomes the leaseholder, as well. You need to meet a
minimum number of riders to receive a van. Before you sign up to create a vanpool, you typically need commitment from
five people for a seven-passenger van, or up to 12 people for a 15-passenger van. You can join a vanpool at any time. You
don’t have to be one of the founding members of a vanpool or an invitee to be part of one. Most programs have a platform
for you to browse through current vanpools and join or request to join one near you. You can be booted for being inactive.
If you’re not paying your fares or not using the service in any way, you can be booted from your vanpool. This can affect
your fellow participants’ monthly fees, so make sure to always communicate with your co-riders.
